Exploratory Data Analysis:
- Visualizations descriptive statistics of the dataset; visual explanations of features &
sharing distributions,
- Example visualizations of aggregated forms based on features (One example can be
grouping the dataset based on genres and comparing distributions or centrality metrics of
features for different genres),
- Analysis of the most popular artists and songs.
- Analyzing how songs of different genres change with time (Temporal analysis of features)

Statistical Analysis & Hypothesis Testing:
- Statistical tests to check how (or if) features contribute to popularity of songs
- Statistical tests to check if significant differences exist between different eras (like
comparing features of 80s and 90s hip-hop)

Machine Learning:
- Prediction of song popularity with various machine learning models
- Efforts on hyper-parameter tuning to increase the performance of models
- Creating a simple song recommendation system using similarity metrics and Nearest Neighbors methods
